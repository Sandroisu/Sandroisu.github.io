            This article will be helpful for those who build android applications that have forms and need to validate
            them.
            Many of those who develop applications on Android have to deal with forms - screens with many fields that
            must be filled in and somehow verified.
            Moreover, there can be a lot of fields, and the customer wants us to not only highlight fields with errors,
            but also make the screen automatically scroll to the topmost error.
            Recently I came across such a requirement and decided to share how I implemented it. Java code
            implementation, since I think that it will not be a problem for anyone to translate it into Kotlin,
            especially since Android Studio helps a lot with this.
        </p>

            The first thing we need to do is create an interface that will represent the field that needs to be checked
            after clicking the "Save/Submit" button.

            We will give it a View as a parameter, it will have a <code>validate()</code> method in which the validation
            procedure will
            take place and two methods regarding the order of the View on the screen<br>
            Next we need to create a class that will keep list of elements to be checked in right order.

        <p class="paragraph_text gray_text">
            Here we have a list of Fields that suppose to be validated and method <code>addFieldToBeValidated()</code>.
            It sets an
            order to new Field object, then deletes object with same order from the list if present and at last point it
            sorts the list by its order. ValidationManager has three more methods:
